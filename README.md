# myPhyloDB
* A user-friendly web-interface for accessing and analyzing taxonomic data from multiple projects and/or sequencing runs.
* The goal of myPhyloDB is to allow for easy comparisons and statistical analysis of microbial (i.e., fungi or bacteria) taxonomic abundance across projects, environments, and management scenarios.
* myPhyloDB accepts Mothur pre-analyzed data from any of its supported sequencing platforms. In addition, raw 454 and Illumina/MiSeq files may be uploaded and analyzed using a user customizable pipeline and myPhyloDB's embedded copy of Mothur.

# Installers
* Installers (coming soon...) of compiled code for Linux and Windows platforms can be found [here] (http://www.ars.usda.gov/services/software/software.htm).
