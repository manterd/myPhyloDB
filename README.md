# myPhyloDB

* A user-friendly web-interface for accessing and analyzing taxonomic data from multiple projects and/or sequencing runs.
* A more detailed reference manual can be found here.
* The goal of myPhyloDB is to allow for easy comparisons and statistical analysis of microbial (i.e., fungi or bacteria) taxonomic abundance across projects, environments, and management scenarios.
* myPhyloDB accepts Mothur pre-analyzed data from any its supported sequencing platforms. In addition, raw 454 and Illumina/MiSeq files may be uploaded and analyzed using a user-customizable Mothur pipeline.
