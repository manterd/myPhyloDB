# myPhyloDB

  *  A user-friendly web-interface for accessing and analyzing taxonomic data from multiple projects and/or sequencing runs.
  *  A more detailed reference manual can be found here.
  *  The goal of myPhyloDB is to allow for easy comparisons and statistical analysis of microbial (i.e., fungi or bacteria) taxonomic abundance across projects, environments, and management scenarios.
  *  myPhyloDB accepts Mothur pre-analyzed data from any its supported sequencing platforms. In addition, raw 454 pyrosequencing files may be uploaded and analyzed using a user-customizable Mothur pipeline.

**Dependencies:**
