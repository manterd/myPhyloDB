<h3>Changes in version 2.3-3</h3>



<h4>BUG FIXES</h4>


<ul>
<li> <p><code>metaMDS</code> and <code>monoMDS</code> could fail if input
dissimilarities were huge: in the reported case they were of
magnitude 1E85. Fixes issue
<a href="https://github.com/vegandevs/vegan/issues/152">#152</a> in
Github.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Permutations failed if they were defined as <span class="pkg">permute</span>
control structures in <code>estaccum</code>, <code>ordiareatest</code>,
<code>renyiaccum</code> and <code>tsallisaccum</code>. Reported by Dan
Gafta (Cluj-Napoca) for <code>renyiaccum</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>rarefy</code> gave false warnings if input was a vector
or a single sampling unit.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Some extrapolated richness indices in <code>specpool</code>
needed the number of doubletons (= number of species occurring
in two sampling units), and these failed when only one sampling
unit was supplied.  The extrapolated richness cannot be
estimated from a single sampling unit, but now such cases are
handled smoothly instead of failing: observed non-extrapolated
richness with zero standard error will be reported. The issue
was reported in
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34027496/error-message-when-using-specpool-in-vegan-package">StackOverflow</a>.
</p>
</li></ul>
 
 


<h4>NEW FEATURES</h4>


<ul>
<li> <p><code>treedist</code> and <code>treedive</code> refuse to handle
trees with reversals, i.e, higher levels are more homogeneous
than lower levels. Function <code>treeheight</code> will estimate
their total height with absolute values of branch
lengths. Function <code>treedive</code> refuses to handle trees with
negative branch heights indicating negative
dissimilarities. Function <code>treedive</code> is faster.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>gdispweight</code> works when input data are in a matrix
instead of a data frame.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Input dissimilarities supplied in symmetric matrices or
data frames are more robustly recognized by <code>anosim</code>,
<code>bioenv</code> and <code>mrpp</code>.
</p>
</li></ul>
 
 


<h3>Changes in version 2.3-2</h3>



<h4>BUG FIXES</h4>


<ul>
<li><p> Printing details of a gridded permutation design would fail
when the grid was at the within-plot level.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>ordicluster</code> joined the branches at wrong coordinates
in some cases.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>ordiellipse</code> ignored weights when calculating standard
errors (<code>kind = "se"</code>). This influenced plots of <code>cca</code>,
and also influenced <code>ordiareatest</code>.
</p>
</li></ul>
 
 


<h4>NEW FEATURES</h4>


<ul>
<li> <p><code>adonis</code> and <code>capscale</code> functions recognize
symmetric square matrices as dissimilarities. Formerly
dissimilarities had to be given as <code>"dist"</code> objects such as
produced by <code>dist</code> or <code>vegdist</code> functions, and data
frames and matrices were regarded as observations x variables
data which could confuse users (e.g., issue
<a href="https://github.com/vegandevs/vegan/issues/147">#147</a>).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>mso</code> accepts <code>"dist"</code> objects for the distances
among locations as an alternative to coordinates of locations.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>text</code>, <code>points</code> and <code>lines</code> functions for
<code>procrustes</code> analysis gained new argument <code>truemean</code>
which allows adding <code>procrustes</code> items to the plots of
original analysis.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>rrarefy</code> returns observed non-rarefied communities
(with a warning) when users request subsamples that are larger
than the observed community instead of failing. Function
<code>drarefy</code> has been similar and returned sampling
probabilities of 1, but now it also issues a warning. Fixes issue
<a href="https://github.com/vegandevs/vegan/issues/144">#144</a> in
Github.
</p>
</li></ul>
 
 


<h3>Changes in version 2.3-1</h3>



<h4>BUG FIXES</h4>


<ul>
<li><p> Permutation tests did not always correctly recognize ties
with the observed statistic and this could result in too low
<i>P</i>-values. This would happen in particular when all predictor
variables were factors (classes). The changes concern functions
<code>adonis</code>, <code>anosim</code>, <code>anova</code> and <code>permutest</code>
functions for <code>cca</code>, <code>rda</code> and <code>capscale</code>,
<code>permutest</code> for <code>betadisper</code>, <code>envfit</code>,
<code>mantel</code> and <code>mantel.partial</code>, <code>mrpp</code>, <code>mso</code>,
<code>oecosimu</code>, <code>ordiareatest</code>, <code>protest</code> and
<code>simper</code>. This also fixes issues
<a href="https://github.com/vegandevs/vegan/issues/120">#120</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/vegandevs/vegan/issues/132">#132</a> in
GitHub.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Automated model building in constrained ordination
(<code>cca</code>, <code>rda</code>, <code>capscale</code>) with <code>step</code>,
<code>ordistep</code> and <code>ordiR2step</code> could fail if there were
aliased candidate variables, or constraints that were completely
explained by other variables already in the model. This was a
regression introduced in <span class="pkg">vegan</span> 2.2-0.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Constrained ordination methods <code>cca</code>, <code>rda</code> and
<code>capscale</code> treat character variables as factors in analysis,
but did not return their centroids for plotting.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Recovery of original data in <code>metaMDS</code> when computing
WA scores for species would fail if the expression supplied to
argument <code>comm</code> was long &amp; got deparsed to multiple
strings. <code>metaMDSdist</code> now returns the (possibly modified)
data frame of community data <code>comm</code> as attribute
<code>"comm"</code> of the returned <code>dist</code> object. <code>metaMDS</code>
now uses this to compute the WA species scores for the NMDS. In
addition, the deparsed expression for <code>comm</code> is now robust to
long expressions.  Reported by Richard Telford.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>metaMDS</code> and <code>monoMDS</code> rejected dissimilarities
with missing values.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Function <code>rarecurve</code> did not check its input and this
could cause confusing error messages. Now function checks that
input data are integers that can be interpreted as counts on
individuals and all sampling units have some species. Unchecked
bad inputs were the reason for problems reported in
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30856909/error-while-using-rarecurve-in-r">Stackoverflow</a>.
</p>
</li></ul>

 


<h4>NEW FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS</h4>


<ul>
<li><p> Scaling of ordination axes in <code>cca</code>, <code>rda</code> and
<code>capscale</code> can now be expressed with descriptive strings
<code>"none"</code>, <code>"sites"</code>, <code>"species"</code> or
<code>"symmetric"</code> to tell which kind of scores should be scaled by
eigenvalues. These can be further modified with arguments
<code>hill</code> in <code>cca</code> and <code>correlation</code> in <code>rda</code>. The
old numeric scaling can still be used.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The permutation data can be extracted from <code>anova</code>
results of constrained ordination (<code>cca</code>, <code>rda</code>,
<code>capscale</code>) and further analysed with <code>permustats</code>
function.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> New data set <code>BCI.env</code> of site information for the Barro
Colorado Island tree community data. Most useful variables are the
UTM coordinates of sample plots. Other variables are constant or
nearly constant and of little use in normal analysis.
</p>
</li></ul>

 


<h3>Changes in version 2.3-0</h3>



<h4>BUG FIXES</h4>


<ul>
<li><p> Constrained ordination functions <code>cca</code>, <code>rda</code> and
<code>capscale</code> are now more robust. Scoping of data set names and
variable names is much improved. This should fix numerous
long-standing problems, for instance those reported by Benedicte
Bachelot (in email) and Richard Telford (in Twitter), as well as
issues <a href="https://github.com/vegandevs/vegan/issues/16">#16</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/vegandevs/vegan/issues/100">#100</a> in
GitHub.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Ordination functions <code>cca</code> and <code>rda</code> silently
accepted dissimilarities as input although their analysis makes
no sense with these methods. Dissimilarities should be analysed
with distance-based redundancy analysis (<code>capscale</code>).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The variance of the conditional component was over-estimated
in <code>goodness</code> of <code>rda</code> results, and results were wrong
for partial RDA. The problems were reported in an
<a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-ecology/2015-March/004936.html">R-sig-ecology</a>
message by Christoph von Redwitz.
</p>
</li></ul>

 


<h4>WINDOWS</h4>


<ul>
<li> <p><code>orditkplot</code> did not add file type identifier to saved
graphics in Windows although that is required. The problem only
concerned Windows OS.
</p>
</li></ul>

 


<h4>NEW FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS</h4>


<ul>
<li> <p><code>goodness</code> function for constrained ordination
(<code>cca</code>, <code>rda</code>, <code>capscale</code>) was redesigned. Function
gained argument <code>addprevious</code> to add the variation explained
by previous ordination components to axes when <code>statistic =
      "explained"</code>. With this option, <code>model = "CCA"</code> will include
the variation explained by partialled-out conditions, and
<code>model = "CA"</code> will include the accumulated variation
explained by conditions and constraints. The former behaviour was
<code>addprevious = TRUE</code> for <code>model = "CCA"</code>, and
<code>addprevious = FALSE</code> for <code>model = "CA"</code>. The argument
will have no effect when <code>statistic = "distance"</code>, but this
will always show the residual distance after all previous
components. Formerly it displayed the residual distance only for
the currently analysed model.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Functions <code>ordiArrowMul</code> and <code>ordiArrowTextXY</code> are
exported and can be used in normal interactive sessions. These
functions are used to scale a bunch arrows to fit ordination
graphics, and formerly they were internal functions used within
other <span class="pkg">vegan</span> functions.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>orditkplot</code> can export graphics in SVG format. SVG is
a vector graphics format which can be edited with several external
programs, such as Illustrator and Inkscape.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Rarefaction curve (<code>rarecurve</code>) and species
accumulation models (<code>specaccum</code>, <code>fitspecaccum</code>)
gained new functions to estimate the slope of curve at given
location. Originally this was based on a response to an
<a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-ecology/2015-May/005038.html">R-SIG-ecology</a>
query. For rarefaction curves, the function is <code>rareslope</code>,
and for species accumulation models it is <code>specslope</code>.
</p>
<p>The functions are based on analytic equations, and can also be
evaluated at interpolated non-integer values. In
<code>specaccum</code> models the functions can be only evaluated for
analytic models <code>"exact"</code>, <code>"rarefaction"</code> and
<code>"coleman"</code>. With <code>"random"</code> and <code>"collector"</code>
methods you can only use finite differences
(<code>diff(fitted(&lt;result.object&gt;))</code>). Analytic functions for
slope are used for all non-linear regression models known to
<code>fitspecaccum</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Species accumulation models (<code>specaccum</code>) and
non-liner regression models for species accumulation
(<code>fitspecaccum</code>) work more consistently with weights. In
all cases, the models are defined using the number of sites as
independent variable, which with weights means that observations
can be non-integer numbers of virtual sites. The <code>predict</code>
models also use the number of sites with <code>newdata</code>,
and for analytic models they can estimate the expected values
for non-integer number of sites, and for non-analytic randomized
or collector models they can interpolate on non-integer values.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>fitspecaccum</code> gained support functions <code>AIC</code>
and <code>deviance</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The <code>varpart</code> plots of four-component models were
redesigned following Legendre, Borcard &amp; Roberts <em>Ecology</em>
93, 1234&ndash;1240 (2012), and they use now four ellipses instead of
three circles and two rectangles. The components are now labelled
in plots, and the circles and ellipses can be easily filled with
transparent background colour.
</p>
</li></ul>

 


<h3>Changes in version 2.2-1</h3>



<h4>GENERAL</h4>


<ul>
<li><p> This is a maintenance release to avoid warning messages
caused by changes in CRAN repository. The namespace usage is also
more stringent to avoid warnings and notes in development versions
of <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span>.
</p>
</li></ul>




<h4>INSTALLATION</h4>


<ul>
<li> <p><span class="pkg">vegan</span> can be installed and loaded without <span class="pkg">tcltk</span>
package. The <span class="pkg">tcltk</span> package is needed in <code>orditkplot</code>
function for interactive editing of ordination graphics.
</p>
</li></ul>

 


<h4>BUG FIXES</h4>


<ul>
<li> <p><code>ordisurf</code> failed if <span class="pkg">gam</span> package was loaded due
to namespace issues: some support functions of <span class="pkg">gam</span> were used
instead of <span class="pkg">mgcv</span> functions.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>tolerance</code> function failed for unconstrained
correspondence analysis.
</p>
</li></ul>

 


<h4>NEW FEATURES</h4>


<ul>
<li> <p><code>estimateR</code> uses a more exact variance formula for
bias-corrected Chao estimate of extrapolated number of
species. The new formula may be unpublished, but it was derived
following the guidelines of Chiu, Wang, Walther &amp; Chao,
<em>Biometrics</em> 70, 671&ndash;682 (2014),
<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/biom.12200/suppinfo">online
supplementary material</a>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Diversity accumulation functions <code>specaccum</code>,
<code>renyiaccum</code>, <code>tsallisaccum</code>, <code>poolaccum</code> and
<code>estaccumR</code> use now <span class="pkg">permute</span> package for permutations
of the order of sampling sites. Normally these functions only
need simple random permutation of sites, but restricted
permutation of the <span class="pkg">permute</span> package and user-supplied
permutation matrices can be used.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>estaccumR</code> function can use parallel processing.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>linestack</code> accepts now expressions as labels. This
allows using mathematical symbols and formula given as
mathematical expressions.
</p>
</li></ul>

 


<h3>Changes in version 2.2-0</h3>



<h4>GENERAL</h4>


<ul>
<li><p> Several <span class="pkg">vegan</span> functions can now use parallel
processing for slow and repeating calculations. All these
functions have argument <code>parallel</code>. The argument can be an
integer giving the number of parallel processes. In unix-alikes
(Mac OS, Linux) this will launch <code>"multicore"</code> processing
and in Windows it will set up <code>"snow"</code> clusters as desribed
in the documentation of the <span class="pkg">parallel</span> package. If <code>option</code>
<code>"mc.cores"</code> is set to an integer &gt; 1, this will be used to
automatically start parallel processing. Finally, the argument
can also be a previously set up <code>"snow"</code> cluster which will
be used both in Windows and in unix-alikes. <span class="pkg">Vegan</span> vignette
on Design decision explains the implementation (use
<code>vegandocs("decission")</code>, and <span class="pkg">parallel</span> package has more
extensive documentation on parallel processing in <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span>.
</p>
<p>The following function use parallel processing in analysing
permutation statistics: <code>adonis</code>, <code>anosim</code>,
<code>anova.cca</code> (and <code>permutest.cca</code>), <code>mantel</code> (and
<code>mantel.partial</code>), <code>mrpp</code>, <code>ordiareatest</code>,
<code>permutest.betadisper</code> and <code>simper</code>. In addition,
<code>bioenv</code> can compare several candidate sets of models in
paralle, <code>metaMDS</code> can launch several random starts in
parallel, and <code>oecosimu</code> can evaluate test statistics for
several null models in parallel.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> All permutation tests are based on the <span class="pkg">permute</span> package
which offers strong tools for restricted permutation. All these
functions have argument <code>permutations</code>. The default usage of
simple non-restricted permutations is achieved by giving a single
integer number. Restricted permutations can be defined using the
<code>how</code> function of the <span class="pkg">permute</span> package. Finally, the
argument can be a permutation matrix where rows define
permutations. It is possible to use external or user constructed
permutations.
</p>
<p>See <code>help(permutations)</code> for a brief introduction on
permutations in <span class="pkg">vegan</span>, and <span class="pkg">permute</span> package for the
full documention. The vignette of the <span class="pkg">permute</span> package can
be read from <span class="pkg">vegan</span> with command
<code>vegandocs("permutations")</code>.
</p>
<p>The following functions use the <span class="pkg">permute</span> package:
<code>CCorA</code>, <code>adonis</code>, <code>anosim</code>, <code>anova.cca</code> (plus
associated <code>permutest.cca</code>, <code>add1.cca</code>,
<code>drop1.cca</code>, <code>ordistep</code>, <code>ordiR2step</code>),
<code>envfit</code> (plus associated <code>factorfit</code> and
<code>vectorfit</code>), <code>mantel</code> (and <code>mantel.partial</code>),
<code>mrpp</code>, <code>mso</code>, <code>ordiareatest</code>,
<code>permutest.betadisper</code>, <code>protest</code> and <code>simper</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Community null model generation has been completely
redesigned and rewritten. The communities are constructed with
new <code>nullmodel</code> function and defined in a low level
<code>commsim</code> function. The actual null models are generated
with a <code>simulate</code> function that builds an array of null
models. The new null models include a wide array of quantitative
models in addition to the old binary models, and users can plug
in their own generating functions. The basic tool invoking and
analysing null models is <code>oecosimu</code>. The null models are
often used only for the analysis of nestedness, but the
implementation in <code>oecosimu</code> allows analysing any
statistic, and null models are better seen as an alternative to
permutation tests.
</p>
</li></ul>
 
 


<h4>INSTALLATION</h4>


<ul>
<li> <p><span class="pkg">vegan</span> package dependencies and namespace imports
were adapted to changes in <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span>, and no more trigger warnings and
notes in package tests.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Three-dimensional ordination graphics using
<span class="pkg">scatterplot3d</span> for static plots and <span class="pkg">rgl</span> for dynamic
plots were removed from <span class="pkg">vegan</span> and moved to a companion
package <span class="pkg">vegan3d</span>. The package is available in CRAN.
</p>
</li></ul>
 
 


<h4>NEW FUNCTIONS</h4>


<ul>
<li><p> Function <code>dispweight</code> implements dispersion weighting
of Clarke et al. (<em>Marine Ecology Progress Series</em>, 320,
11&ndash;27).  In addition, we implemented a new method for
generalized dispersion weighting <code>gdispweight</code>. Both
methods downweight species that are significantly
over-dispersed.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> New <code>hclust</code> support functions <code>reorder</code>,
<code>rev</code> and <code>scores</code>. Functions <code>reorder</code> and
<code>rev</code> are similar as these functions for <code>dendrogram</code>
objects in base <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span>. However, <code>reorder</code> can use (and defaults
to) weighted mean. In weighted mean the node average is always the
mean of member leaves, whereas the <code>dendrogram</code> uses always
unweighted means of joined branches.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Function <code>ordiareatest</code> supplements <code>ordihull</code> and
<code>ordiellipse</code> and provides a randomization test for the
one-sided alternative hypothesis that convex hulls or ellipses in
two-dimensional ordination space have smaller areas than with
randomized groups.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Function <code>permustats</code> extracts and inspects permutation
results with support functions <code>summary</code>, <code>density</code>,
<code>densityplot</code>, <code>qqnorm</code> and <code>qqmath</code>. The
<code>density</code> and <code>qqnorm</code> are standard <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> tools that only
work with one statistic, and <code>densityplot</code> and <code>qqmath</code>
are <span class="pkg">lattice</span> graphics that work with univariate and
multivariate statistics. The results of following functions can be
extracted: <code>anosim</code>, <code>adonis</code>, <code>mantel</code> (and
<code>mantel.partial</code>), <code>mrpp</code>, <code>oecosimu</code>,
<code>permustest.cca</code> (but not the corresponding <code>anova</code>
methods), <code>permutest.betadisper</code>, and <code>protest</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>stressplot</code> functions display the ordination distances
at given number of dimensions against original distances.  The
method functins are similar to <code>stressplot</code> for
<code>metaMDS</code>, and always use the inherent distances of each
ordination method. The functions are available for the results
<code>capscale</code>, <code>cca</code>, <code>princomp</code>, <code>prcomp</code>,
<code>rda</code>, and <code>wcmdscale</code>.
</p>
</li></ul>
 
 


<h4>BUG FIXES</h4>


<ul>
<li> <p><code>cascadeKM</code> of only one group will be <code>NA</code> instead
of a random value. 
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>ordiellipse</code> can handle points exactly on a line,
including only two points (with a warning).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> plotting <code>radfit</code> results for several species failed if
any of the communities had no species or had only one species.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>RsquareAdj</code> for <code>capscale</code> with negative
eigenvalues will now report <code>NA</code> instead of using biased
method of <code>rda</code> results.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>simper</code> failed when a group had only a single member.
</p>
</li></ul>

 


<h4>NEW FEATURES</h4>


<ul>
<li> <p><code>anova.cca</code> functions were re-written to use the
<span class="pkg">permute</span> package. Old results may not be exactly
reproduced, and models with missing data may fail in several
cases. There is a new option of analysing a sequence of models
against each other.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>simulate</code> functions for <code>cca</code> and <code>rda</code>
can return several simulations in a <code>nullmodel</code> compatible
object. The functions can produce simulations with correlated
errors (also for <code>capscale</code>) in parametric simulation with
Gaussian error.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>bioenv</code> can use Manhattan, Gower and Mahalanobis
distances in addition to the default Euclidean. New helper
function <code>bioenvdist</code> can extract the dissimilarities
applied in best model or any other model.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>metaMDS(..., trace = 2)</code> will show convergence
information with the default <code>monoMDS</code> engine.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Function <code>MDSrotate</code> can rotate a <i>k</i>-dimensional
ordination to <i>k-1</i> variables. When these variables are
correlated (like usually is the case), the vectors can also be
correlated to previously rotated dimensions, but will be
uncorrelated to all later ones.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><span class="pkg">vegan</span> 2.0-10 changed the weighted <code>nestednodf</code>
so that weighted analysis of binary data was equivalent to
binary analysis. However, this broke the equivalence to the
original method. Now the function has an argument <code>wbinary</code>
to select the method of analysis. The problem was reported and a
fix submitted by Vanderlei Debastiani (Universidade Federal do
Rio Grande do Sul, Brasil).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>ordiellipse</code>, <code>ordihull</code> and <code>ordiellipse</code>
can handle missing values in <code>groups</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>ordispider</code> can now use spatial medians instead of
means. 
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>rankindex</code> can use Manhattan, Gower and Mahalanobis
distance in addition to the default Euclidean.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> User can set colours and line types in function
<code>rarecurve</code> for plotting rarefaction curves.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>spantree</code> gained a support function <code>as.hclust</code>
to change the minimum spanning tree into an <code>hclust</code> tree.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>fitspecaccum</code> can do weighted analysis. Gained
<code>lines</code> method.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Functions for extrapolated number of species or for the size
of species pool using Chao method were modified following Chiu et
al., <em>Biometrics</em> 70, 671&ndash;682 (2014).
</p>
<p>Incidence based <code>specpool</code> can now use (and defaults to)
small sample correction with number of sites as the sample
size. Function uses basic Chao extrapolation based on the ratio of
singletons and doubletons, but switches now to bias corrected Chao
extrapolation if there are no doubletons (species found
twice). The variance formula for bias corrected Chao was derived
following the supporting
<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/biom.12200/suppinfo">online material</a>
and differs slightly from Chiu et al. (2014).
</p>
<p>The <code>poolaccum</code> function was changed similarly, but the small
sample correction is used always.
</p>
<p>The abundance based <code>estimateR</code> uses bias corrected Chao
extrapolation, but earlier it estimated its variance with classic
Chao model. Now we use the widespread
<a href="http://viceroy.eeb.uconn.edu/EstimateS/EstimateSPages/EstSUsersGuide/EstimateSUsersGuide.htm#AppendixB">approximate
equation</a> for variance.
</p>
<p>With these changes these functions are more similar to
<a href="http://viceroy.eeb.uconn.edu/EstimateS/EstimateSPages/EstSUsersGuide/EstimateSUsersGuide.htm#AppendixB">EstimateS</a>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>tabasco</code> uses now <code>reorder.hclust</code> for
<code>hclust</code> object for better ordering than previously when it
cast trees to <code>dendrogram</code> objects.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>treedive</code> and <code>treedist</code> default now to
<code>match.force = TRUE</code> and can be silenced with
<code>verbose = FALSE</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>vegdist</code> gained Mahalanobis distance.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Nomenclature updated in plant community data with the help
of <span class="pkg">Taxonstand</span> and <span class="pkg">taxize</span> packages. The taxonomy of
the <code>dune</code> data was adapted to the same sources and APG
III.  <code>varespec</code> and <code>dune</code> use 8-character names (4
from genus + 4 from species epithet). New data set on
phylogenetic distances for <code>dune</code> was extracted from Zanne
et al. (<em>Nature</em> 506, 89&ndash;92; 2014).

</li>
<li><p> User configurable plots for <code>rarecurve</code>.
</p>
</li></ul>
 
 


<h4>DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT</h4>


<ul>
<li> <p><code>strata</code> are deprecated in permutations. It is still
accepted but will be phased out in next releases. Use <code>how</code>
of <span class="pkg">permute</span> package.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>cca</code>, <code>rda</code> and <code>capscale</code> do not return
scores scaled by eigenvalues: use <code>scores</code> function to
extract scaled results.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>commsimulator</code> is deprecated. Replace
<code>commsimulator(x, method)</code> with
<code>simulate(nullmodel(x, method))</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>density</code> and <code>densityplot</code> for permutation
results are deprecated: use <code>permustats</code> with its
<code>density</code> and <code>densityplot</code> method.
</p>
</li></ul>
 
 


<h3>Changes in version 2.0-10</h3>



<h4>GENERAL</h4>


<ul>
<li><p> This version is adapted to the changes in <span class="pkg">permute</span>
package version 0.8-0 and no more triggers NOTEs in package
checks.  This release may be the last of the 2.0 series, and the
next <span class="pkg">vegan</span> release is scheduled to be a major release with
newly designed <code>oecosimu</code> and community pattern simulation,
support for parallel processing, and full support of the
<span class="pkg">permute</span> package. If you are interested in these
developments, you may try the development versions of
<span class="pkg">vegan</span> in
<a href="http://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/vegan/">R-Forge</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/jarioksa/vegan">GitHub</a> and report the
problems and user experience to us.  </p>
</li></ul>
   


<h4>BUG FIXES</h4>


<ul>
<li> <p><code>envfit</code> function assumed that all external variables
were either numeric or factors, and failed if they were, say,
character strings. Now only numeric variables are taken as
continuous vectors, and all other variables (character strings,
logical) are coerced to factors if possible. The function also
should work with degenerate data, like only one level of a
factor or a constant value of a continuous environmental
variable. The ties were wrongly in assessing permutation
<i>P</i>-values in <code>vectorfit</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>nestednodf</code> with quantitative data was not
consistent with binary models, and the fill was wrongly
calculated with quantitative data.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>oecosimu</code> now correctly adapts displayed quantiles
of simulated values to the <code>alternative</code> test direction.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>renyiaccum</code> plotting failed if only one level of
diversity <code>scale</code> was used.
</p>
</li></ul>

 


<h4>NEW FEATURES</h4>

 
 
<ul>
<li><p> The Kempton and Taylor algorithm was found unreliable in
<code>fisherfit</code> and <code>fisher.alpha</code>, and now the estimation
of Fisher <i>alpha</i> is only based on the number of
species and the number of individuals.  The estimation of
standard errors and profile confidence intervals also had to be
scrapped.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>renyiaccum</code>, <code>specaccum</code> and
<code>tsallisaccum</code> functions gained <code>subset</code> argument.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>renyiaccum</code> can now add a <code>collector</code> curve to
to the analysis. The collector curve is the diversity
accumulation in the order of the sampling units. With an
interesting ordering or sampling units this allows comparing
actual species accumulations with the expected randomized
accumulation.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>specaccum</code> can now perform weighted accumulation
using the sampling effort as weights.
</p>
</li></ul>

 


<h3>Changes in version 2.0-9</h3>


<ul>
<li><p> This version is released due to changes in programming
interface and testing procedures in <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> 3.0.2. If you are using an
older version of <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span>, there is no need to upgrade <span class="pkg">vegan</span>. There
are no new features nor bug fixes. The only user-visible changes
are in documentation and in output messages and formatting. Because
of <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> changes, this version is dependent on <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> version 2.14.0
or newer and on <span class="pkg">lattice</span> package.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>Changes in version 2.0-8</h3>



<h4>GENERAL</h4>


<ul>
<li><p> This is a maintenance release that fixes some issues
raised by changed in <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> toolset for processing vignettes.  In
the same we also fix some typographic issues in the vignettes.
</p>
</li></ul>

 


<h4>NEW FEATURES</h4>


<ul>
<li> <p><code>ordisurf</code> gained new arguments for more flexible
definition of fitted models to better utilize the
<span class="pkg">mgcv</span><code>::gam</code> function. 
</p>
<p>The linewidth of contours can
now be set with the argument <code>lwd</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Labels to arrows are positioned in a better way in
<code>plot</code> functions for the results of <code>envfit</code>,
<code>cca</code>, <code>rda</code> and <code>capscale</code>. The labels should no
longer overlap the arrow tips.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The setting test direction is clearer in <code>oecosimu</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>ordipointlabel</code> gained a <code>plot</code> method that can
be used to replot the saved result.
</p>
</li></ul>

 


<h3>Changes in version 2.0-7</h3>



<h4>NEW FUNCTIONS</h4>


<ul>
<li> <p><code>tabasco()</code> is a new function for graphical display
of community data matrix.  Technically it is an interface to <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span>
<code>heatmap</code>, but its use is closer to <span class="pkg">vegan</span> function
<code>vegemite</code>. The function can reorder the community data
matrix similarly as <code>vegemite</code>, for instance, by ordination
results. Unlike <code>heatmap</code>, it only displays dendrograms if
supplied by the user, and it defaults to re-order the
dendrograms by correspondence analysis.  Species are ordered to
match site ordering or like determined by the user.
</p>
</li></ul>

 


<h4>BUG FIXES</h4>


<ul>
<li><p> Function <code>fitspecaccum(..., model = "asymp")</code> fitted
logistic model instead of asymptotic model (or the same as 
<code>model = "logis"</code>).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>nestedtemp()</code> failed with very sparse data (fill
<i>&lt; 0.38</i>%).
</p>
</li></ul>

 


<h4>NEW FEATURES</h4>


<ul>
<li><p> The <code>plot</code> function for constrained ordination
results (<code>cca</code>, <code>rda</code>, <code>capscale</code>) gained
argument <code>axis.bp</code> (defaults <code>TRUE</code>) which can be used
to suppress axis scale for biplot arrays.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Number of iterations in nonmetric multidimensional scaling
(NMDS) can be set with keyword <code>maxit</code> (defaults
<code>200</code>) in <code>metaMDS</code>.
</p>
</li></ul>

 


<h4>DEPRECATED</h4>


<ul>
<li><p> The result objects of <code>cca</code>, <code>rda</code> and
<code>capscale</code> will no longer have scores <code>u.eig</code>,
<code>v.eig</code> and <code>wa.eig</code> in the future versions of
<span class="pkg">vegan</span>. This change does not influence normal usage,
because <span class="pkg">vegan</span> functions do not need these items.  However,
external scripts and packages may need changes in the future
versions of <span class="pkg">vegan</span>.
</p>
</li></ul>
   
 


<h3>Changes in version 2.0-6</h3>



<h4>BUG FIXES</h4>


<ul>
<li><p> The species scores were scaled wrongly in
<code>capscale()</code>. They were scaled correctly only when Euclidean
distances were used, but usually <code>capscale()</code> is used with
non-Euclidean distances.  Most graphics will change and should be
redone.  The change of scaling mainly influences the spread of
species scores with respect to the site scores.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Function <code>clamtest()</code> failed to set the minimum
abundance threshold in some cases. In addition, the output was
wrong when some of the possible species groups were missing. Both
problems were reported by Richard Telford (Bergen, Norway).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Plotting an object fitted by <code>envfit()</code> would fail if
<code>p.max</code> was used and there were unused levels for one or
more factors. The unused levels could result from deletion of
observations with missing values or simply as the result of
supplying a subset of a larger data set to <code>envfit()</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>multipart()</code> printed wrong information about the
analysis type (but did the analysis correctly). Reported by
Valerie Coudrain.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>oecosimu()</code> failed if its <code>nestedfun</code> returned a
data frame. A more fundamental fix will be in <span class="pkg">vegan</span> 2.2-0,
where the structure of the <code>oecosimu()</code> result will change.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The plot of two-dimensional <code>procrustes()</code> solutions
often draw original axes in a wrong angle. The problem was
reported by Elizabeth Ottesen (MIT).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Function <code>treedive()</code> for functional or phylogenetic
diversity did not correctly match the species names between the
community data and species tree when the tree contained species
that did not occur in the data.  Related function
<code>treedist()</code> for phylogenetic distances did not try to match
the names at all.
</p>
</li></ul>

 


<h4>NEW FEATURES</h4>


<ul>
<li><p> The output of <code>capscale()</code> displays the value of the
additive constant when argument <code>add = TRUE</code> was used.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>fitted()</code> functions for <code>cca()</code>, <code>rda()</code> and
<code>capscale()</code> can now return conditioned (partial) component
of the response: Argument <code>model</code> gained a new alternative
<code>model = "pCCA"</code>. 
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>dispindmorisita()</code> output gained a new column for
Chi-squared based probabilities that the null hypothesis (random
distribution) is true.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>metaMDS()</code> and <code>monoMDS()</code> have new default
convergence criteria. Most importantly, scale factor of the
gradient (<code>sfgrmin</code>) is stricter. The former limit was too
slack with large data sets and iterations stopped early without
getting close to the solution. In addition, <code>scores()</code>
ignore now requests to dimensions beyond those calculated
instead of failing, and <code>scores()</code> for <code>metaMDS()</code>
results do not drop dimensions.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>msoplot()</code> gained <code>legend</code> argument for
positioning the legend.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Nestedness function <code>nestednodf()</code> gained a <code>plot</code>
method.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>ordiR2step()</code> gained new argument <code>R2scope</code>
(defaults <code>TRUE</code>) which can be used to turn off the criterion
of stopping when the adjusted <i>R-squared</i> of the current
model exceeds that of the scope.  This option allows model
building when the <code>scope</code> would be overdetermined (number of
predictors higher than number of observations).
</p>
<p><code>ordiR2step()</code> now handles partial redundancy analysis
(pRDA).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>orditorp()</code> gained argument <code>select</code> to select
the rows or columns of the results to display.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>protest()</code> prints the standardized residual statistic
<i>squared m12</i> in addition to the squared Procrustes
correlation <i>R-squared</i>.  Both were calculated, but only
the latter was displayed.
</p>
<p>Permutation tests are much faster in <code>protest()</code>. Instead
of calling repeatedly <code>procrustes()</code>, the goodness of fit
statistic is evaluated within the function. 
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>wcmdscale()</code> gained methods for <code>print</code>,
<code>plot</code> etc. of the results. These methods are only used if
the full <code>wcmdscale</code> result is returned with, e.g., argument
<code>eig = TRUE</code>. The default is still to return only a matrix of
scores similarly as the standard <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> function <code>cmdscale()</code>,
and in that case the new methods are not used.
</p>
</li></ul>

 


<h3>Changes in version 2.0-5</h3>



<h4>BUG FIXES</h4>


<ul>
<li> <p><code>anova(&lt;cca_object&gt;, ...)</code> failed with
<code>by = "axis"</code> and <code>by = "term"</code>. The bug was reported by
Dr Sven Neulinger (Christian Albrecht University, Kiel, Germany).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>radlattice</code> did not honour argument <code>BIC = TRUE</code>,
but always displayed AIC.
</p>
</li></ul>

 


<h4>NEW FUNCTIONS</h4>


<ul>
<li><p> Most <span class="pkg">vegan</span> functions with permutation tests have now a
<code>density</code> method that can be used to find empirical
probability distributions of permutations. There is a new
<code>plot</code> method for these functions that displays both the
density and the observed statistic. The <code>density</code> function is
available for <code>adonis</code>, <code>anosim</code>, <code>mantel</code>,
<code>mantel.partial</code>, <code>mrpp</code>, <code>permutest.cca</code> and
<code>procrustes</code>.
</p>
<p>Function <code>adonis</code> can return several statistics, and it has
now a <code>densityplot</code> method (based on <span class="pkg">lattice</span>).
</p>
<p>Function <code>oecosimu</code> already had <code>density</code> and
<code>densityplot</code>, but they are now similar to other <span class="pkg">vegan</span>
methods, and also work with <code>adipart</code>, <code>hiersimu</code> and
<code>multipart</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>radfit</code> functions got a <code>predict</code> method that
also accepts arguments <code>newdata</code> and <code>total</code> for new
ranks and site totals for prediction.  The functions can also
interpolate to non-integer &ldquo;ranks&rdquo;, and in some models
also extrapolate.
</p>
</li></ul>

 


<h4>NEW FEATURES</h4>


<ul>
<li><p> Labels can now be set in the <code>plot</code> of <code>envfit</code>
results. The labels must be given in the same order that the
function uses internally, and new support function <code>labels</code>
can be used to display the default labels in their correct order.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Mantel tests (functions <code>mantel</code> and
<code>mantel.partial</code>) gained argument <code>na.rm</code> which can be
used to remove missing values. This options should be used with
care: Permutation tests can be biased if the missing values were
originally in matching or fixed positions.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>radfit</code> results can be consistently accessed with
the same methods whether they were a single model for a single
site, all models for a single site or all models for all sites
in the data.  All functions now have methods <code>AIC</code>,
<code>coef</code>, <code>deviance</code>, <code>logLik</code>, <code>fitted</code>,
<code>predict</code> and <code>residuals</code>.
</p>
</li></ul>

 


<h4>INSTALLATION AND BUILDING</h4>


<ul>
<li><p> Building of <span class="pkg">vegan</span> vignettes failed with the latest
version of LaTeX (TeXLive 2012).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> versions later than 2.15-1 (including development
version) report warnings and errors when installing and checking
<span class="pkg">vegan</span>, and you must upgrade <span class="pkg">vegan</span> to this version.
The warnings concern functions <code>cIndexKM</code> and
<code>betadisper</code>, and the error occurs in <code>betadisper</code>.
These errors and warnings were triggered by internal changes in
<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span>.
</p>
</li></ul>

 


<h3>Changes in version 2.0-4</h3>



<h4>BUG FIXES</h4>


<ul>
<li> <p><code>adipart</code> assumed constant gamma diversity in
simulations when assessing the <i>P</i>-value.  This could give
biased results if the null model produces variable gamma
diversities and option <code>weights = "prop"</code> is used.  The
default null model (<code>"r2dtable"</code>) and the default option
(<code>weights = "unif"</code>) were analysed correctly.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>anova(&lt;prc-object&gt;, by = "axis")</code> and other
<code>by</code> cases failed due to &lsquo;<span class="file">NAMESPACE</span>&rsquo; issues.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>clamtest</code> wrongly used frequencies instead of the
counts when calculating sample coverage.  No detectable
differences were produced when rerunning examples from Chazdon
et al. 2011 and <span class="pkg">vegan</span> help page.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>envfit</code> failed with unused factor levels.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>predict</code> for <code>cca</code> results with
<code>type = "response"</code> or <code>type = "working"</code> failed with
<code>newdata</code> if the number of rows did not match with the
original data.  Now the <code>newdata</code> is ignored if it has a
wrong number of rows.  The number of rows must match because
the results in <code>cca</code> must be weighted by original row
totals.  The problem did not concern <code>rda</code> or
<code>capscale</code> results which do not need row weights.
Reported by Glenn De'ath.
</p>
</li></ul>




<h4>NEW FEATURES</h4>


<ul>
<li><p> Functions for diversity partitioning (<code>adipart</code>,
<code>hiersimu</code> and <code>multipart</code>) have now <code>formula</code>
and <code>default</code> methods.  The <code>formula</code> method is
identical to the previous functions, but the <code>default</code>
method can take two matrices as input. 
</p>
<p>Functions <code>adipart</code> and <code>multipart</code> can be used for
fast and easy overall partitioning to alpha, beta and gamma
diversities by omitting the argument describing the hierarchy.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The method in <code>betadisper</code> is biased with small
sample sizes.  The effects of the bias are strongest with
unequal sample sizes. A bias adjusted version was developed by
Adrian Stier and Ben Bolker, and can be invoked with argument
<code>bias.adjust</code> (defaults to <code>FALSE</code>).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>bioenv</code> accepts dissimilarities (or square matrices
that can be interpreted as dissimilarities) as an alternative to
community data.  This allows using other dissimilarities than
those available in <code>vegdist</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>plot</code> function for <code>envfit</code> results gained new
argument <code>bg</code> that can be used to set background colour for
plotted labels.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>msoplot</code> is more configurable, and allows, for
instance, setting y-axis limits.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Hulls and ellipses are now filled using semitransparent
colours in <code>ordihull</code> and <code>ordiellipse</code>, and the
user can set the degree of transparency with a new argument
<code>alpha</code>.  The filled shapes are used when these functions
are called with argument <code>draw = "polygon"</code>.  Function
<code>ordihull</code> puts labels (with argument <code>label = TRUE</code>)
now in the real polygon centre.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>ordiplot3d</code> returns function <code>envfit.convert</code>
and the projected location of the <code>origin</code>.  Together
these can be used to add <code>envfit</code> results to existing
<code>ordiplot3d</code> plots.
</p>
<p>Equal aspect ratio cannot be set exactly in <code>ordiplot3d</code>
because underlying core routines do not allow this. Now
<code>ordiplot3d</code> sets equal axis ranges, and the documents
urge users to verify that the aspect ratio is reasonably equal
and the graph looks like a cube.  If the problems cannot be
solved in the future, <code>ordiplot3d</code> may be removed from
next releases of <span class="pkg">vegan</span>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Function <code>ordipointlabel</code> gained argument to
<code>select</code> only some of the items for plotting. The
argument can be used only with one set of points.
</p>
</li></ul>

 


<h3>Changes in version 2.0-3</h3>



<h4>NEW FUNCTIONS</h4>


<ul>
<li><p> Added new nestedness functions <code>nestedbetasor</code> and
<code>nestedbetajac</code> that implement multiple-site dissimilarity
indices and their decomposition into turnover and nestedness
components following Baselga (<em>Global Ecology and
Biogeography</em> 19, 134&ndash;143; 2010).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Added function <code>rarecurve</code> to draw rarefaction curves
for each row (sampling unit) of the input data, optionally with
lines showing rarefied species richness with given sample size
for each curve.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Added function <code>simper</code> that implements
&ldquo;similarity percentages&rdquo; of Clarke (<em>Australian
Journal of Ecology</em> 18, 117&ndash;143; 1993).  The method compares
two or more groups and decomposes the average between-group
Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index to contributions by individual
species.  The code was developed in 
<a href="https://github.com/jarioksa/vegan">GitHub</a>
by Eduard Szöcs (Uni Landau, Germany).
</p>
</li></ul>

 


<h4>BUG FIXES</h4>


<ul>
<li> <p><code>betadisper()</code> failed when the <code>groups</code> was a
factor with empty levels.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Some constrained ordination methods and their support
functions are more robust in border cases (completely aliased
effects, saturated models, user requests for non-existng scores
etc). Concerns <code>capscale</code>, <code>ordistep</code>, <code>varpart</code>,
<code>plot</code> function for constrained ordination, and
<code>anova(&lt;cca.object&gt;, by = "margin")</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The <code>scores</code> function for <code>monoMDS</code> did not
honour <code>choices</code> argument and hence dimensions could not be
chosen in <code>plot</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The default <code>scores</code> method failed if the number of
requested axes was higher than the ordination object had.  This
was reported as an error in <code>ordiplot</code> in
<a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-ecology/2012-February/002768.html">R-sig-ecology</a> mailing list.
</p>
</li></ul>

 


<h4>NEW FEATURES</h4>


<ul>
<li> <p><code>metaMDS</code> argument <code>noshare = 0</code> is now
regarded as a numeric threshold that always triggers extended
dissimilarities (<code>stepacross</code>), instead of being treated
as synonymous with <code>noshare = FALSE</code> which always
suppresses extended dissimilarities.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Nestedness discrepancy index <code>nesteddisc</code> gained a
new argument that allows user to set the number of iterations
in optimizing the index.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>oecosimu</code> displays the mean of simulations and
describes alternative hypothesis more clearly in the printed
output. 
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Implemented adjusted <i>R-squared</i> for partial
RDA. For partial model <code>rda(Y ~ X1 + Condition(X2))</code> this
is the same as the component <code>[a] = X1|X2</code> in variance
partition in <code>varpart</code> and describes the marginal (unique)
effect of constraining term to adjusted <i>R-squared</i>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Added Cao dissimilarity (CYd) as a new dissimilarity
method in <code>vegdist</code> following Cao et al., <em>Water
Envir Res</em> 69, 95&ndash;106 (1997). The index should be good for
data with high beta diversity and variable sampling
intensity. Thanks to consultation to Yong Cao (Univ Illinois,
USA).
</p>
</li></ul>

 


<h3>Changes in version 2.0-2</h3>



<h4>BUG FIXES</h4>


<ul>
<li><p> Function <code>capscale</code> failed if constrained component
had zero rank. This happened most likely in partial models when
the conditions aliased constraints. The problem was observed in
<code>anova(..., by ="margin")</code> which uses partial models to
analyses the marginal effects, and was reported in an email
message to
<a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2011-October/293077.html">R-News
mailing list</a>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>stressplot</code> and <code>goodness</code> sometimes failed when
<code>metaMDS</code> was based on <code>isoMDS</code> (<span class="pkg">MASS</span> package)
because <code>metaMDSdist</code> did not use the same defaults for
step-across (extended) dissimilarities as
<code>metaMDS(..., engine = "isoMDS")</code>. The change of defaults can
also influence triggering of step-across in
<code>capscale(..., metaMDSdist = TRUE)</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>adonis</code> contained a minor bug resulting from
incomplete implementation of a speed-up that did not affect the
results. In fixing this bug, a further bug was identified in
transposing the hat matrices. This second bug was only active
following fixing of the first bug. In fixing both bugs, a
speed-up in the internal f.test() function is fully
realised. Reported by Nicholas Lewin-Koh.
</p>
</li></ul>

  


<h4>NEW FEATURES</h4>


<ul>
<li> <p><code>ordiarrows</code> and <code>ordisegments</code> gained argument
<code>order.by</code> that gives a variable to sort points within
<code>groups</code>. Earlier the points were assumed to be in order.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Function <code>ordispider</code> invisibly returns the
coordinates to which the points were connected.  Typically these
are class centroids of each point, but for constrained ordination
with no <code>groups</code> they are the LC scores.
</p>
</li></ul>
		 
  


<h3>Changes in version 2.0-1</h3>



<h4>NEW FUNCTIONS</h4>


<ul>
<li> <p><code>clamtest</code>: new function to classify species as
generalists and specialists in two distinct habitats (CLAM test of
Chazdon et al., <em>Ecology</em> 92, 1332&ndash;1343; 2011).  The test is
based on multinomial distribution of individuals in two habitat
types or sampling units, and it is applicable only to count data
with no over-dispersion.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>as.preston</code> gained <code>plot</code> and <code>lines</code>
methods, and <code>as.fisher</code> gained <code>plot</code> method (which
also can add items to existing plots). These are similar as
<code>plot</code> and <code>lines</code> for <code>prestonfit</code> and
<code>fisherfit</code>, but display only data without the fitted lines.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>raupcrick</code>: new function to implement Raup-Crick
dissimilarity as a probability of number of co-occurring species
with occurrence probabilities proportional to species
frequencies.  <span class="pkg">Vegan</span> has Raup-Crick index as a choice in
<code>vegdist</code>, but that uses equal sampling probabilities for
species and analytic equations. The new <code>raupcrick</code>
function uses simulation with <code>oecosimu</code>. The function
follows Chase et al. (2011) <em>Ecosphere</em> 2:art24
[<a href="http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/ES10-00117.1">doi:10.1890/ES10-00117.1</a>],
and was developed with the consultation of Brian Inouye.
</p>

<h4>BUG FIXES</h4>


<ul>
<li><p> Function <code>meandist</code> could scramble items and give
wrong results, especially when the <code>grouping</code> was
numerical. The problem was reported by Dr Miguel Alvarez
(Univ. Bonn).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>metaMDS</code> did not reset <code>tries</code> when a new model
was started with a <code>previous.best</code> solution from a different
model. 
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Function <code>permatswap</code> for community null models using
quantitative swap never swapped items in a <i>2 by 2</i>
submatrix if all cells were filled.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The result from <code>permutest.cca</code> could not be
<code>update</code>d because of a &lsquo;<span class="file">NAMESPACE</span>&rsquo; issue.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> 2.14.0 changed so that it does not accept using
<code>sd()</code> function for matrices (which was the behaviour at
least since <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> 1.0-0), and several <span class="pkg">vegan</span> functions were
changed to adapt to this change (<code>rda</code>, <code>capscale</code>,
<code>simulate</code> methods for <code>rda</code>, <code>cca</code> and
<code>capscale</code>). The change in <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> 2.14.0 does not influence the
results but you probably wish to upgrade <span class="pkg">vegan</span> to avoid
annoying warnings.
</p>
</li></ul>
	
 


<h4>ANALYSES</h4>


<ul>
<li> <p><code>nesteddisc</code> is slacker and hence faster when trying
to optimize the statistic for tied column frequencies. Tracing
showed that in most cases an improved ordering was found rather
early in tries, and the results are equally good in most cases.
</p>
</li></ul>

 


<h3>Changes in version 2.0-0</h3>



<h4>GENERAL</h4>


<ul>
<li><p> Peter Minchin joins the <span class="pkg">vegan</span> team.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><span class="pkg">vegan</span> implements standard <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> &lsquo;<span class="file">NAMESPACE</span>&rsquo;. In
general, <code>S3</code> methods are not exported which means that you
cannot directly use or see contents of functions like
<code>cca.default</code>, <code>plot.cca</code> or <code>anova.ccabyterm</code>. To
use these functions you should rely on <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> delegation and simply
use <code>cca</code> and for its result objects use <code>plot</code> and
<code>anova</code> without suffix <code>.cca</code>. To see the contents of
the function you can use <code>:::</code>, such as
<code>vegan:::cca.default</code>. This change may break packages,
documents or scripts that rely on non-exported names.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><span class="pkg">vegan</span> depends on the <span class="pkg">permute</span> package. This
package provides powerful tools for restricted permutation
schemes. All <span class="pkg">vegan</span> permutation will gradually move to use
<span class="pkg">permute</span>, but currently only <code>betadisper</code> uses the new
feature. 
</p>
</li></ul>

 


<h4>NEW FUNCTIONS</h4>


<ul>
<li> <p><code>monoMDS</code>: a new function for non-metric
multidimensional scaling (NMDS). This function replaces
<code>MASS::isoMDS</code> as the default method in
<code>metaMDS</code>. Major advantages of <code>monoMDS</code> are that it
has &lsquo;weak&rsquo; (&lsquo;primary&rsquo;) tie treatment which means
that it can split tied observed dissimilarities.  &lsquo;Weak&rsquo;
tie treatment improves ordination of heterogeneous data sets,
because maximum dissimilarities of <i>1</i> can be split. In
addition to global NMDS, <code>monoMDS</code> can perform local and
hybrid NMDS and metric MDS.  It can also handle missing and zero
dissimilarities.  Moreover, <code>monoMDS</code> is faster than
previous alternatives. The function uses <code>Fortran</code> code
written by Peter Minchin.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>MDSrotate</code> a new function to replace
<code>metaMDSrotate</code>. This function can rotate both <code>metaMDS</code>
and <code>monoMDS</code> results so that the first axis is parallel to
an environmental vector.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>eventstar</code> finds the minimum of the evenness profile
on the Tsallis entropy, and uses this to find the corresponding
values of diversity, evenness and numbers equivalent following
Mendes et al. (<em>Ecography</em> 31, 450-456; 2008). The code was
contributed by Eduardo Ribeira Cunha and Heloisa Beatriz Antoniazi
Evangelista and adapted to <span class="pkg">vegan</span> by Peter Solymos.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>fitspecaccum</code> fits non-linear regression models to
the species accumulation results from <code>specaccum</code>. The
function can use new self-starting species accumulation models
in <span class="pkg">vegan</span> or other self-starting non-linear regression
models in <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span>. The function can fit Arrhenius, Gleason, Gitay,
Lomolino (in <span class="pkg">vegan</span>), asymptotic, Gompertz,
Michaelis-Menten, logistic and Weibull (in base <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span>) models. The
function has <code>plot</code> and <code>predict</code> methods.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Self-starting non-linear species accumulation models
<code>SSarrhenius</code>, <code>SSgleason</code>, <code>SSgitay</code> and
<code>SSlomolino</code>. These can be used with <code>fitspecaccum</code> or
directly in non-linear regression with <code>nls</code>. These functions
were implemented because they were found good for species-area
models by Dengler (<em>J. Biogeogr.</em> 36, 728-744; 2009).
</p>
</li></ul>

 


<h4>NEW FEATURES</h4>


<ul>
<li> <p><code>adonis</code>, <code>anosim</code>, <code>meandist</code> and
<code>mrpp</code> warn on negative dissimilarities, and
<code>betadisper</code> refuses to analyse them. All these functions
expect dissimilarities, and giving something else (like
correlations) probably is a user error.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>betadisper</code> uses restricted permutation of the
<span class="pkg">permute</span> package. 
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>metaMDS</code> uses <code>monoMDS</code> as its default ordination
engine. Function gains new argument <code>engine</code> that can be used
to alternatively select <code>MASS::isoMDS</code>.  The default is not
to use <code>stepacross</code> with <code>monoMDS</code> because its
&lsquo;weak&rsquo; tie treatment can cope with tied maximum
dissimilarities of one. However, <code>stepacross</code> is the default
with <code>isoMDS</code> because it cannot handle adequately these tied
maximum dissimilarities.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>specaccum</code> gained <code>predict</code> method which uses
either linear or spline interpolation for data between observed
points. Extrapolation is possible with spline interpolation, but
may make little sense.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>specpool</code> can handle missing values or empty factor
levels in the grouping factor <code>pool</code>.  Now also checks that
the length of the <code>pool</code> matches the number of
observations.
</p>
</li></ul>

 


<h4>DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT</h4>


<ul>
<li> <p><code>metaMDSrotate</code> was replaced with <code>MDSrotate</code>
that can also handle the results of <code>monoMDS</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>permuted.index2</code> and other &ldquo;new&rdquo; permutation
code was removed in favour of the <span class="pkg">permute</span> package. This code
was not intended for normal use, but packages depending on that
code in <span class="pkg">vegan</span> should instead depend on <span class="pkg">permute</span>.
</p>
</li></ul>
  
 


<h4>ANALYSES</h4>


<ul>
<li> <p><code>treeheight</code> uses much snappier code. The results
should be unchanged.
</p>
</li></ul>
