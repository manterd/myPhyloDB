Version 0.1.2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* `print.gtable` now prints the z order of the grobs, and it no longer
  sort the names by z order. Previously, the layout names were sorted by
  z order, but the grobs weren't. This resulted in a mismatch between
  the names and the grobs. It's better to not sort by z by default,
  since that doesn't match how indexing works. The `zsort` option allows
  the output to be sorted by z.
