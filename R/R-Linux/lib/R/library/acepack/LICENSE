The following, concerning ACE, written by Tom "spot" Callaway, is from
the Fedora R-acepack RPM.

The copyright on the ace implementation was clear, but its licensing 
terms were not. I was able to clarify the terms with the copyright holder:

Right. I should have remembered that.

You hereby have my permission to distribute my ACE code in Fedora.

Great! Now, I just need to know under what licensing terms we can
distribute it under. :)

If none of those licenses seems correct to you, let me know, and I will
show you some others.
