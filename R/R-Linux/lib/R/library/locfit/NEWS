1.5-9:

o Support for user-supplied basis function has been withdrawn until further notice.

o Changed akima from Import to Suggest.  The interp() function from akima is used 
  conditionally in preplot.locfit().  Anyone who needs it will have to install
  akima, whose license is more restrictive than locfit's.  If it's needed but 
  not available, an error message is given with a note regarding the license.
  
1.5-8:

o Added a subset method for the "lp" class to resolve the problem that in a locfit()
  call, if "subset" is given then any optional argument to lp() are ignored.

1.5-7:

o Patches by Brian Ripley (added NAMESPACE, changed Call_S(), etc.)

1.5-6:

o Added check for 0-row data so locfit() won't segfault.


1.5-5:

o Patches provided by Brian Ripley to clean up some function arguments and
  documentations.
